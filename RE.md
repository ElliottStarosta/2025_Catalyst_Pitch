### Personalized Energy Impact:

Unlike polls or social platforms that provide generic ratings, Senergy calculates a **personalized energy impact** per activity for each user. The Adjustment Factor serves as the foundation for this personalization by:

* **Individual Baseline**: Each user's personality creates a unique baseline for how they experience social environments
* **Activity-Specific Adjustments**: The same activity affects different users differently based on their personality profile
* **Dynamic Prediction**: Rather than static ratings, the system predicts how each specific user would rate an activity based on their personality alignment
* **Energy Conservation**: Helps users identify activities that will energize rather than drain them personally

This approach transforms generic crowd-sourced ratings into personalized energy predictions that account for individual social energy patterns.
